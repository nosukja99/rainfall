    sort them into ascending sequence and display them to the monitor		

	
	ALGORITHM : compare each letters and sort by ascending order 
	
	===================================
	INPUT : String firstL, secondL, thirdL

	PROCESSING STEPS : compare firstL and secondL and change by ascending order 
	                   and then compare thirdL to firstL and also compare to thirdL to secondL

	OUTPUTS : all three letters by ascending order

	=================================
	PSEUDOCODE : Initialize String firstL to null
	             Initialize String secondL to null
				 Initialize String thirdL to null
				 Initialize String temp to null
	             Prompt user input a first letter
				 Get firstL
				 prompt user input a second letter
				 if second letter is same to first letter
				    prompt user to input another letter
				 Get secondL
				 prompt user input a third letter
				 if third letter is same to first letter or second letter
				    prompt user to input another letter
				 Get thirdL
				 
				 IF (firstL is greater than secondL)
					 THEN
					   temp = firstL
					   firstL = secondL
					   secondL = temp
					   IF( FirstL is greater than thirdL)
					   THEN
							  temp = firstL
							  firstL = thirdL
							  thirdL = temp
							  IF (secondL is greater than thirdL)
							  THEN
									temp = secondL
									secondL = thirdL
									thirdL = temp
							  ENDIF
						ENDIF
					   ELSE 
					   IF ( secondL is greater than thirdL)
					   THEN
							  temp = secondL
							  secondL = thirdL
							  thirdL = temp
					   ENDIF
					
			     ELSE
				 IF ( firstL is greater than thirdL)
				 THEN 
					temp = firstL
					firstL=thirdL
					thirdL=temp
				 ELSE
				 IF (secondL is greater than thirdL)
				 THEN
				    temp = secondL
					secondL = thirdL
					thirdL=temp
				
				Diaplay firstL, secondL, thirdL
2. A program is required to read a customer’s name, a purchase amount and a tax code. 
The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:
    0  tax exempt (0%)
    1  state sales tax only (3%)
    2  federal and state sales tax (5%)
    3  special sales tax (7%)
The program must then compute the sales tax and the total amount due,and print the customer’s name, 
purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.

    ALGORITHM : compute the tax and total amount due and display 
	
	===================================
	INPUT : String name, purchase, taxCode

	PROCESSING STEPS : According to the input tax code, compute each tax 
	and add it to the purchase to get totla amount

	OUTPUTS : sales tax and total amount

	=================================
	PSEUDOCODE : Initialize String name to null
	             Initialize double purchase to zero
				 Initialize String taxCode to null
				 Initialize double salesTax to zero
				 Initialize double totlaAmount to zero
	             Prompt user input name, purchase, and taxCode
				 Get name, purchase, taxCode
				 CASE OF taxCode
				    0: salesTax =0 totlaAmount=purchase
