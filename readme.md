How much water runs off the roof
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them 
to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. 
In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of 
gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).
